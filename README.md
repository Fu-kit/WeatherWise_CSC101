At the beginning of this project, I used the starter code provided by my lecturer as a base for development. The initial setup included several components aimed to guide us in building the WeatherWise application. However, as I progressed and began implementing code that was meant to meet all functional requirements, I encountered several challenges that hindered efficient development.

One of the primary issues was the need for an API key that could not be readily identified or obtained through the original codebase. Additionally, several errors arose during execution, and determining which code components were conflicting required considerable effort. It quickly became clear that continuing with the existing approach would be time-consuming and inefficient.

As a result, I shifted my strategy and turned to AI tools to generate a new version of the code that would fulfill all project requirements from scratch. I began by using a code snippet generated by DeepSeek. While this version got me closer to the goal, it still produced two errors upon execution.

To troubleshoot further, I showed the faulty code and its output to several other AI models, including Claude and Perplexity. I asked each model to analyze the code and either fix the issues or suggest a complete alternative solution. All three models—DeepSeek, Perplexity, and Claude—provided updated versions of the code.

I then tested each one. The version provided by Claude stood out, as it ran smoothly without any errors and included a complete set of functionalities: fetching weather data from a real API (with a fallback to mock data), natural language parsing, and a menu-driven interface using pyinputplus.

By choosing Claude’s version and customizing it for my specific project requirements, I was able to complete the application efficiently. This iterative collaboration between myself and multiple AI tools significantly improved both the speed and quality of development. Rather than focusing all my time on debugging, I could concentrate on refining the application logic and user experience.

In summary, using AI as a coding partner helped me solve critical development problems, explore multiple implementation options, and ultimately deliver a working application that meets the brief. I also learned that testing AI-generated code across different platforms and refining prompts iteratively is key to achieving optimal results.
